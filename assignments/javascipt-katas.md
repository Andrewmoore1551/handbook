## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of types, functions, argument-handling, loops, and
  conditional statements

## Requirements

1.  Fork [this repository](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/unit-i-katas) to
    your own account.
2.  Change into your training directory
3.  Clone your repository: `hub clone unit-i-katas`
4.  Change into your project's directory: `cd unit-i-katas`
5.  Install the dependencies: `npm install --save`
6.  Open in Code: `code .`
7.  Start the test runner: `npm start`
8.  Feel free to split screen your work, except now you should split-screen your
    editor and your TERMINAL
9.  In your editor, open `src/functions.test.js` and work on each function until
    the test pass.
10. Each time you save your code, the tests run and tell you if your code is
    correct.
11. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
12. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No linter warnings
- [ ] Turn in the homework using the URL to your repository on Github.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] If you used "built-in" JavaScript methods like `String.reverse()` or
      `Array.max()` to solve these problems, try implementing them from scratch.
- [ ] Vice-versa: if you implemented your solutions from scratch, look in the
      documentation linked below to see if JavaScript has any built-in functions
      to help solve these problems.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Expand the `sum` and `max` functions to take arrays instead of numbers and
      update the tests so they pass.
- [ ] Create your own simple functions with tests.
- [ ] Anytime in your code that you used a `for` loop or a `while` loop, convert
      it to use a `map`, `filter` or `reduce`.

## Additional Resources

Reference the documentation on MDN to find what kind of helpful functions might
already be on `Array` and `String` in JavaScript.

- [Array Functions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
