tags: ['javascript', 'enumeration', 'algorithms']
---

Using JavaScript takes practice and the best practice is repetition. This
exercise allows you time to work on the basics of JavaScript and how to apply
that logic to solving problems.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of iteration/enumeration

## Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/function-junction) to
   your own account.
2. Change into your projects directory:
3. Clone your repository: `hub clone function-junction`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd function-junction``
5. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
6. Open in your editor
7. Start the test runner: `npm test`
8. Open `src/functions.test.js` and work on functions until tests pass.
9. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
10. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.

## Explorer Mode

- Work on `function-junction` using the directions above
- Finish the code and have all tests passing
- Have no linter warnings
- Turn in the homework using the URL to your repository on GitHub.

## Adventure Mode

- Do the same with the Function-Junction Koans at
  [https://github.com/suncoast-devs/js-iteration](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/js-iteration)

- Do the same with the JavaScript Koans at
  [https://github.com/suncoast-devs/koans/blob/master/koans.js](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/koans/blob/master/koans.js)

## Epic Mode

- Using the `forEach` looping method and no other looping or enumeration helper,
  write your **own version** of the following methods, except name yours `_map`,
  `_filter`, etc.
  - `map`
  - `filter`
  - `reduce`
  - `every`
  - `some`

might already be in JavaScript.
