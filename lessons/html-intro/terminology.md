| HTML      | HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Tag       | In HTML, tags are referring to the code written before and after the element to define what type of HTML property it belongs to. For example, in `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` the tags are referring to the `<h1>` and `</h1>`                                                                                       |
| Element   | In HTML, elements are referring to the content inside the tags. For example in `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`, `Hello World!` is the element.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Hyperlink | A hyperlink is often referred to as a link, is a path often represented as HTML elements where it can be clicked to direct the user to another document/data. Hyperlinks can refer to documents/data inside the project or anything on the web with a link.                                                     |
| Block     | Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line.                                                                                                                   |
| Inline    | Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content.                                                                                                                               |
| Attribute | HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. For example in `<a className="title" href="./MyFolder/world.html">Hello World!</a>`, the attribute refers to `className="title"` and `href="./MyFolder/world.html"`                                           |
| Metadata  | Metadata defines the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other information on the HTML document you are working on.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Semantics | HTML elements with meaning. For example, `<h1>`, `<a>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<form>`are all tags that give meaning to the browser on what type of tags they are. Non-semantic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>` are tags that do not have meaning to the browser where it can be used more freely. |
