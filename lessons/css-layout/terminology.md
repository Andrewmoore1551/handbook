| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Display Property | The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box such as `none`,`inline`, `block`, `inline-block`, `flex`, and `grid`) of an element.                                                                                  |
| Flexbox          | Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout Module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension â€” either as a row or as a column.                                                                                   |
| Grid             | two-dimensional way of laying out objects in a grid-like pattern. Much like a table, CSS Grid is composed of rows and columns.                                                                                                                       |
| Float            | A property that changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around the floated item. |
| Positioning      | Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would be placed when in normal flow to another location.                                                                                                                                     |
