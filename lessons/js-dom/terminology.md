| Document Object Model (DOM) | The data representation of objects that comprise the structure and document content on the web. In other words, the HTML in your app                              |
| Query                       | A request for information to be retrieved. In our case, we request certain elements in the DOM to work with the same way CSS selectors select elements in the DOM |
| Events                      | `Things` that happen to HTML elements. Javascript then reacts to these elements when `something` happens                                                          |
